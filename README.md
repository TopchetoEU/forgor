# F.O.R.G.O.R

As the RAM prices have soared, our team is looking for new an innovative solutions to this problem. In our search, we have invented the world's first RAM-less language! This language requires no RAM (except for the interpreter and OS, of course) to run.

Of course, your programs still might need to remember some values. In such cases, you will need to ask the rememorour to remember and to recall the values for you. This however might prove to be quite taxing on the rememorour, so stray away from using variables.

Note that some features of lua have been disabled, to keep the complexity of programs manageable.

## Addendum

Some of our users have reported that manually remembering all of the variable values is rather overwhelming. This is why our team has developed another helper program, to help you remember the variable values - the rememorour. Note that using this program defeats the whole premise of a RAM-less experience.
